ABOUT THIS BOOK

CRC Press, 2024

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CODES

We have kept the number of required external Python packages intentionally at a minimum, so that newcomers to Python can follow the codes easily.

All figures in this book were produced using the scripts in this repository, so that users know immediately what to expect when they run the scripts.

Experienced programmers will quickly find out that they can improve the codes given here, and it is of course possible to make the codes more compact 
and elegant. However, we chose to provide R codes which are simple and clear, and which can be easily modified for the purposes of the reader, 
rather than attempting to create compact codes which may be difficult to follow and modify.

We hope you will find the scripts useful and that you will enjoy running and modifying the various files. If you find that some script is not clear or has inaccuracies, kindly let me know at vpagonis@mcdaniel.edu

Enjoy!
